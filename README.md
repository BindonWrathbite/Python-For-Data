# Data Analytics Course
This repo is used to show the completed problems in Luke Barousse's "Python for Data Analytics" course.

## Background
I originally started work in Python over a year ago and have started to develop my own applications. I decided to pick up this course because I am looking to gain skills in using Python for Data Analytics and I really enjoy Luke Barousse's approach to teaching material. I am primarily using this to gain knowledge and skill regarding the different libraries used in Python for Data Analytics.
